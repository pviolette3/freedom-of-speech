<h1>Why did I get censored?</h1>

It could be any or several of the following reasons:

<h4>PROFANITY/SEXUAL CONTENT</h4>
	Many socially conservative countries, such as Syria and Iran, take a strong stance against loose speech. Sexual topics are generally highly restricted, reflecting the everyday laws of those countries which are restrictive to the rights of women as well as discriminatory against homosexuality. Violaters of the edicts against profanity or sexual content online, including pornography as well as frank discussion of sexuality, can be fined or even jailed. Governments which restrict on a moral basis are attempting to create a purer society.

<h4>POLITICAL DISSENT</h4>
	Bloggers in China, Iran, Ethiopia, and Egypt (pre-2011) found themselves on the wrong side of the law when their political dissent lead to being fined or even arrested. Political dissent is one of the principal go-to areas of censorship for an active authoritarian government. Censorship on a political basis is motivated by the belief that the state should have authority, and if the people are given the freedom to criticize the government or even organize resistance, that can only lead to chaos and a negative environment.

<h4>ILLEGAL CONTENT</h4>
	Even countries like France, which have a generally liberal view on freedom of speech online, can be sensitive to the distribution of copyrighted materials. France has enacted a controversial Three Strikes law dictating that anyone found guilty of distributing or helping to distribute copyrighted material illegally can be fined and have access to the internet restricted. Countries which censor based on illegal content are more active in business protection, which sometimes may come at a cost to the freedom of individual internet users.

<h4>SENSITIVE TOPIC</h4>
	In countries like Iran and China, there are some topics political or otherwise which the government would prefer not be discussed online. These topics can change from year to year or day to day, but this kind of restriction is the most troubling for supporters of free speech because the topics are chosen by arbitrary edict rather than general ethical rules. Sensitive topics can include religious, political, sexual, or illegal content; the motivation for censorship of sensitive topics is to prevent the populace at large from knowing or talking about certain topics found to be subversive or dangerous by the state government.
