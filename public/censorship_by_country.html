                <h4>CHINA:</h4>
                <p>China has one of the largest and most extensive programs of Internet censorship in the world. Over sixty Internet regulations having been made by the government, and these regulations are enforced both by the government itself and by private companies which own websites, who enforce the rules out of fear of being punished themselves. The Chinese government is said to employ over 30,000 human censors of the Internet. Amnesty International has reported that China has the "largest recorded number of imprisoned journalists and cyber-dissidents in the world." The scope of the censorship is typically political in nature, with criticism of government policies, discussion of sensitive topic, or any unauthorized organization of persons being expressly forbidden.</p>

                <h4>EGYPT (pre-2011):</h4>
                <p>During the regime of President Mubarak pre-2011, Internet in Egypt was not directly censored. However, bloggers critical to his regime were regularly watched and arrested. During the 2011 Egyptian protests, because protestors were organizing and developing international support online, the government instantiated a complete shutdown of the popular social media website Twitter and Facebook. This was followed a couple of days later by the government completely shutting down all access to the Internet.</p>

            <div class="row-fluid">
                <h4>ETHIOPIA:</h4>
                <p>Ethiopia is highly restrictive against online content which is critical of the government.  Despite the small amount of available Internet access in the country (Ethiopia has the second-lowest rate of Internet access in sub-Saharan Africa, only above Sierra Leone), the government is very vigilant in preventing any access to, contribution to, or use of politicall sensitive or dissenting material. Numerous bloggers have been arrested under "terrorism" charges for expressing dissent, and sentenced long jail terms. The Ethiopian government has also attempted to restrict or ban forms of online communication like Skype which is more difficult to censor than text-based sites, and officials are said to confront or arrest users of Internet cafes who were visiting politically sensitive websites. </p>

            <div class="row-fluid">
                <h4>FRANCE:</h4>
                <p>Though France has typically been fairly liberal in the past, there have been recent changes to Internet law which is worrisome for supporters of freedom of speech online. Holocaust denial or content which is deemed supportive of Nazism has been banned for a long time, as well as content considered hate speech and child pornography. Recently they have also initiated a Three Strikes law, by which repeat offenders of copyright law can be punished and potentially have their Internet access restricted.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row-fluid">
                <h4>IRAN:</h4>
                <p>Iran has the second highest rate of Internet use in the Middle East, after only Israel. However, despite this high rate of use, Iran is highly restrictive in the use of Internet by its citizens. Reasons for censorship can include political reasons, religious reasons, or moral reasons. Because of the highly religious nature of Iran's government, there is a lot of overlap in these areas. Bloggers and dissentors are regularly arrested for content they've posted online. In 2007, five women were sent to prison over "endangering national security" by collecting over a million signatures in a petition against discrimination of women in Iran. Pornographic and anti-religion websites are typically banned, and popular social media websites such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are often restricted or banned in Iran.</p>

            <div class="row-fluid">
                <h4>SYRIA:</h4>
                <p>The Syrian government monitors online activity very closely, and has frequently arrested bloggers, writers, and dissentors. The rules for Internet regulation are very ambiguous and arbitrary, leading many citizens to be afraid of what they might say because it's unknown if an official in the government might find it offensive enough to inflict punishment. Vague guidelines for appropriate content are the most dangerous for freedom of speech online, because citizens are no longer able to tell whether they are following the rules are not and are kept in line out of fear. The Arabic-language Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter have all been blocked at various phases due to real or percieved political threats to the Syrian government.During the recent Syrian civil war restrictions have tightened more than ever, including a brief shutdown of 3G, DSL, and dial-up services to prevent the organization of protests and marches. Syrian rebels have attempted numerous times to provide outlets and alternatives, attempting to circumvent restrictions as much as possible.</p>
